# Survive Game Highscores - Web Application (Private Repository) 
# Start: January 21th
The Survive game was made by [jacoblap](https://github.com/jacoblap) and the web highscores was made by myself.

This mobile application is made with:

- Python (Game)
- JavaScript (HighScores)

Technologies & Framework:
- React (Highscores' Frontend) React-Router as the navigator
- NodeJS (Highscores' Backend) with an Express REST API 
- MongoDB (Highscores' Database)

The goal of the game is to make the best score by killing other dots around you. You can also get powers to help yourself around you.

# Content: The Game

You can download the game on Jacob`s website (http://jacoblaprise.com/) and try it yourself. Here is a demo of it:

# Content: The Highscores

When the user dies on the game, it asks him to enter his name. That name is then registered into the highscores on the frontend:

The user can download the game, play (coming later) or view the game`s owner website in the navigation bar.
If you have less than 10 points on the highscores, you cannot be shown on it.

Also, the user can see a user's profile. It can be viewed by searching on the search bar input or by clicking on a user`s profile:
The user will be redirected to /user/Max for example.
