# Survive Game Highscores - Web Application (Private Repository) 
# Start: January 21th
The Survive game was made by [jacoblap](https://github.com/jacoblap) and the web highscores was made by myself.

This mobile application is made with:

- Python (Game)
- JavaScript (HighScores)

Technologies & Framework:
- React (Highscores' Frontend) React-Router as the navigator
- NodeJS (Highscores' Backend) with an Express REST API 
- MongoDB (Highscores' Database)

The goal of the game is to make the best score by killing other dots around you. You can also get powers to help yourself around you.

Here is a demo of it:

# Content: The Highscores

When the user dies on the game, it asks him to enter his name. That name is then registered into the highscores on the frontend:

The user can download the game, play (coming later) or view the game`s owner website in the navigation bar.
If you have less than 10 points on the highscores, you cannot be shown on it.

Also, the user can see a user's profile. It can be viewed by searching on the search bar input or by clicking on a user`s profile:
The user will be redirected to /user/Max for example.
